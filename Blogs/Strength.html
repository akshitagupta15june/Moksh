                <h6><strong>Struggle to Fit In: Navigating Pressure and Identity</strong></h6>
              <p> Some
                children attend international schools while others go to regular schools. Some parents celebrate
                birthdays
                in a grand manner, while others don't.
                These
                contrasting experiences have a significant impact on both the child and the parent. Comparisons among
                children arise, such as academic performance,
                which
                affects the child's mindset as all these factors accumulate in their mind. Nowadays, every child is
                focused
                on their career and aspiring to go
                abroad. They
                often leave their homes to live in hostels, where they are exposed to shocking differences. They
                struggle to
                comprehend seeing other children with
                iPhones,
                laptops, and extravagant spending habits, appearing intelligent, confident, and multi-talented. This
                hypocrisy is difficult for them to digest,
                including the
                prevalence of romantic relationships. The pressure to fit in leads some into depression, negativity, and
                jealousy. They may resort to negative
                habits like
                smoking and gambling, further spiraling into a state of depression.

              <h6><strong>Embrace Individuality, Resist Peer Pressure for Personal Growth</strong></h6>
              <p>
                In such situations, it becomes challenging for youngsters to stand up for the truth. While they are
                aware of
                the wrongness of smoking or drinking,
                they lack the
                strength to resist peer pressure. Here, Dadaji comes into their lives as a brave role model who guides
                them
                towards the path of truth. In college,
                they
                encounter numerous temptations, face ridicule if they don't participate, and feel lonely if they choose
                to
                stand apart. It's essential to consider
                the long-term
                consequences of succumbing to negative influences, as it not only affects the individual but also their
                entire family. The aim of life should be
                peace of mind,
                not just money. It's crucial to seek peace in positive and protective environments, surround oneself
                with
                courageous people, and never feel alone.
                Sometimes,
                going against the majority is the right path to take for one's career and personal growth.

              <h6><strong>Faith as a Guiding Light: Embracing Divine Support and Inner Strength</strong></h6>
                <p>
                <b><i>"God is with you."</i></b> When you believe that He is there with you, watching over you, how can
                you
                do something wrong? How can you follow
                the wrong
                path? The feeling
                of support is there with you, supporting you. Your Guru will be there, and your own family will send
                support
                for you. Small temptations that come
                your way...
                Swami Vivekananda has said, 'Stand up, be brave, be bold. You are the creator of your own destiny, so
                you
                have to create your own destination. Your
                entire life
                is in your hands. As you sow, so shall you reap. If you get into bad company, you are ruining your whole
                life. If you stay in the company of good
                people, you
                will make your life successful. Don't hesitate to open up and speak up about any doubts or questions in
                your
                mind. If you don't communicate, you
                will keep
                overthinking, and you won't know whether you are right or wrong in your decisions. Open up and speak up
                to
                your friends or family. You can manage to
                speak to
                them, or we will show you the right path. You will not be betrayed. You may feel tempted when you see
                your
                friends having boyfriends or girlfriends
                while you
                don't, and someone tells you that you are outdated. You feel low about it, out of place, uncomfortable
                going
                for outings or parties. But don't you
                realize that
                the majority consists of fools? You are on the right path, so why assume that you are wrong? You are, in
                fact, right. Stand by what is right, be
                bold, and don't
                be scared. We are scared of rejection, but if our friends reject us, they were not meant to join us in
                our
                party. We will be left alone, but don't
                worry. God is
                with you, and your family is here. You can enjoy them. Dadaji, wants all youngsters as of all, the
                soldier,
                has to always be brave.we cannot be
                depressed, we
                cannot be unhappy. You have to be strong, brave, ever ready, shining, sparkling like the sun. Dadaji
                tells
                us that we are sons of Lord Suraj Devta,
                so we should
                always be shining and happy. The sun always shines, sparks always cover up the darkness. So we, as sons
                of
                God, sons of Surya Devta, should also
                spread light in
                the universe. All the darkness inside us will vanish if we carry the Guru's teachings with us. It is
                possible."
