              truggle to Fit In: Navigating Pressure and Identity
            </p>
            <p class="mb-4">
              Some
              children attend international schools while others go to regular schools. Some parents celebrate
              birthdays
              in a grand manner, while others don't.
              These
              contrasting experiences have a significant impact on both the child and the parent. Comparisons among
              children arise, such as academic performance,
              which
              affects the child's mindset as all these factors accumulate in their mind. Nowadays, every child is
              focused
              on their career and aspiring to go
              abroad. They
              often leave their homes to live in hostels, where they are exposed to shocking differences. They
              struggle to
              comprehend seeing other children with
              iPhones,
              laptops, and extravagant spending habits, appearing intelligent, confident, and multi-talented. This
              hypocrisy is difficult for them to digest,
              including the
              prevalence of romantic relationships. The pressure to fit in leads some into depression, negativity,
              and
              jealousy. They may resort to negative
              habits like
              smoking and gambling, further spiraling into a state of depression.
            </p>
            <p class="mb-4">
              <b>Embrace Individuality, Resist Peer Pressure for Personal Growth</b> <br />
              In such situations, it becomes challenging for youngsters to stand up for the truth. While they are
              aware of
              the wrongness of smoking or drinking,
              they lack the
              strength to resist peer pressure. Here, Dadaji comes into their lives as a brave role model who guides
              them
              towards the path of truth. In college,
              they
              encounter numerous temptations, face ridicule if they don't participate, and feel lonely if they
              choose
              to
              stand apart. It's essential to consider
              the long-term
              consequences of succumbing to negative influences, as it not only affects the individual but also
              their
              entire family. The aim of life should be
              peace of mind,
              not just money. It's crucial to seek peace in positive and protective environments, surround oneself
              with
              courageous people, and never feel alone.
              Sometimes,
              going against the majority is the right path to take for one's career and personal growth.

              <b>Faith as a Guiding Light: Embracing Divine Support and Inner Strength</b> <br />

              <b><i>"God is with you."</i></b> When you believe that He is there with you, watching over you, how
              can
              you
              do something wrong? How can you follow
              the wrong
              path? The feeling
              of support is there with you, supporting you. Your Guru will be there, and your own family will send
              support
              for you. Small temptations that come
              your way...
              Swami Vivekananda has said, 'Stand up, be brave, be bold. You are the creator of your own destiny, so
              you
              have to create your own destination. Your
              entire life
              is in your hands. As you sow, so shall you reap. If you get into bad company, you are ruining your
              whole
              life. If you stay in the company of good
              people, you
              will make your life successful. Don't hesitate to open up and speak up about any doubts or questions
              in
              your
              mind. If you don't communicate, you
              will keep
              overthinking, and you won't know whether you are right or wrong in your decisions. Open up and speak
              up
              to
              your friends or family. You can manage to
              speak to
              them, or we will show you the right path. You will not be betrayed. You may feel tempted when you see
              your
              friends having boyfriends or girlfriends
              while you
              don't, and someone tells you that you are outdated. You feel low about it, out of place, uncomfortable
              going
              for outings or parties. But don't you
              realize that
              the majority consists of fools? You are on the right path, so why assume that you are wrong? You are,
              in
              fact, right. Stand by what is right, be
              bold, and don't
              be scared. We are scared of rejection, but if our friends reject us, they were not meant to join us in
              our
              party. We will be left alone, but don't
              worry. God is
              with you, and your family is here. You can enjoy them. Dadaji, wants all youngsters as of all, the
              soldier,
              has to always be brave.we cannot be
              depressed, we
              cannot be unhappy. You have to be strong, brave, ever ready, shining, sparkling like the sun. Dadaji
              tells
              us that we are sons of Lord Suraj Devta,
              so we should
              always be shining and happy. The sun always shines, sparks always cover up the darkness. So we, as
              sons
              of
              God, sons of Surya Devta, should also
              spread light in
              the universe. All the darkness inside us will vanish if we carry the Guru's teachings with us. It is
              possible."
