            ive vices are the five thieves we are always trying to find happiness from. However, the happiness we
            obtain from them
            is very temporary. Out of all the worthy things we pursue outside ourselves, we only experience temporary
            happiness.
            This creates a void inside us, and that void generates emotions, which are our vices.

          </p>
          <p class="mb-4">
            The five vices are known as the "vikar" in Hindi. They are "kam" (desire or lust), "krodh" (anger), "lobh"
            (greed),
            "moh" (worldly attraction), and "ahankar" (false ego). Today, we will address these five vices.
          </p>
          <p class="mb-4">
            Firstly, there is desire or lust. When this desire is unfulfilled, it leads to anger. Anger arises when we
            don't obtain
            what we want. This anger then turns into frustration and becomes a form of greed. Once we acquire what we
            desire, we
            become attached to worldly possessions, thinking that they belong to us. Finally, there is the ego, the
            false sense of
            self-importance that arises when we believe we have earned or achieved something. These five vices are
            like poisons.
          </p>
          <p class="mb-4">
            When discussing Ravana, a pious and religious man, we learn that his desire for Sita, the most beautiful
            woman, led to
            his downfall and death. All of us have these five vices within us, although some people may have more
            anger, attachment,
            or other specific tendencies. These vices are referred to as "thieves" because, like thieves, they steal
            something from
            us. When we recognize that they are attacking us, we naturally try to distance ourselves from them.
            Although it may seem
            natural to experience anger, greed, attachment, or ego, our Guru teaches us that these are all things
            attacking us.
            Therefore, we must separate ourselves from these vices.
          </p>
          <p class="mb-4">
            These vices are the reason why they are called thieves. They steal away our happiness, providing only
            temporary
            happiness in return. They rob us of our inner peace. For example, if we become angry, expressing our
            emotions may
            provide temporary satisfaction and happiness. However, these vices prevent us from experiencing lasting
            happiness, which
            is what I am referring to as the "everlasting happiness" that the Guru helps us channelize.
          </p>

              <span class="pb-1 border-b-4 border-double border-b-indigo-600">Lust or Desire (Kam)</span>
            </span>
            Now, let's focus on the first vice, lust or desire. When we speak about lust, we often associate it with
            sexual desire.
            However, if we consider the religious aspect, having excessive sexual desire is considered a sin.
            Psychologically,
            though, a healthy sexual desire is considered normal. Today, we will examine the spiritual aspect of lust.
            Sexual desire
            itself is natural and normal. For instance, if you are married, sexual desire is necessary for
            procreation. However,
            when it overpowers and becomes an addiction, it is called lust. Lust is not limited to sexual desire; it
            can apply to
            any form of desire. It refers to any desire that overwhelms and hypnotizes us, leading to blind obsession
            and craving.
            It clouds our judgment and makes it difficult to say no to those desires. Lust can manifest as an
            overpowering desire
            for another person, an obsession with food or certain experiences, or a craving for visual or sensory
            stimuli.
          </p>
          <p class="mb-4">
            When it comes to lust, we are never satisfied. We always want more and more. It's like a pot with holes;
            when you fill
            it, you temporarily have water, but it will eventually drain out through the holes. So, the water becomes
            useless.
            Similarly, our bodies are like pots, and desires are like the holes in our bodies. When we fulfill one
            desire, we
            experience temporary happiness, but more desires arise. It's a continuous cycle of wanting more in our
            lives. For
            example, a cricketer worked their entire life to receive a certain award and when asked how are you
            feeling so he said
            so what? Once you have a desire to get a big house when u get it now you need a servant for maintenance so
            you see it's
            a circle of desire.So, there is no end to this desire. We need to channelize it. Don't desire only
            material things, but
            start desiring knowledge.

          </p>
          <p class="mb-4">
            <span class="heading font-semibold text-indigo-600 mb-4 block">
              <span class="pb-1 border-b-4 border-double border-b-indigo-600">Anger (Krodh)</span>
            </span>
            Now, coming to the second vice, which is anger. What is the main cause of anger? Desire. So, if any desire
            is
            unfulfilled, you are bound to get angry. If you are hurt in any way or something has hurt you, you are
            going to get
            angry. Another reason why we get angry is because we believe we are right and others are wrong. We
            constantly try to
            prove that we are right and the other person is wrong. Many times, we blame others for our anger, but most
            of the time
            it is due to unfulfilled desires. We get angry when someone is rude to us or frustrates us. We either
            remove the
            frustration or take it out on someone else. There is a constant need to prove that I am right and you are
            wrong.
            However, when someone is angry, instead of attacking them, we should try to stop being angry ourselves.
            When we see
            someone angry, we try to provoke them, and in the process, we also become angry. It becomes a vicious
            cycle. Our Guru
            teaches us that when we are getting angry, we need to channelize ourselves and ask why our mind is not
            working properly,
            why our ego is getting hurt, and why our desires are causing anger. So, instead of blaming others for our
            anger, we
            should target ourselves and not believe others.

          </p>

              <span class="pb-1 border-b-4 border-double border-b-indigo-600">Greed (Lobh)</span>
            </span>
            The third vice is greed. What is greed? It is basically wanting more and more, and it should not be earned
            through
            unfair means. For example, if someone is in business and they have a monopoly on a certain product, they
            may charge five
            times the amount. Their conscience might tell them that this is greed. So, they asked Guruji if the amount
            they are
            charging is greed. Guruji told them that it is their right and not greed, as long as they are not cheating
            others or
            using unfair means. Greed comes into play when we see others following unfair means and succeeding, so we
            are tempted to
            do the same. However, Guru teaches us that greed is unethical earning and not the right way to earn. This
            greed will
            create karma, and whatever harm it causes in the future will come back to us. For example, if someone
            injects water
            instead of medicine to earn more, it is greed. They played with people's health because of their own
            greed. In the end,
            their greed backfired and they ended up behind bars. To channelize this greed, if you have a desire for
            outward progress
            or knowledge, you can redirect that greed towards wanting to learn more and progress on the spiritual
            path.
          </p>

              <span class="pb-1 border-b-4 border-double border-b-indigo-600">Attachment (Moh)</span>
            </span>
            The fourth vice is worldly attachments. Some people feel that emotional attachment is kind of okay. For
            example, as a
            mother, I have an attachment to my child, and it's fine. As a wife, it's normal to be attached. However,
            the Guru
            teaches us that this worldly attachment will keep us stuck and bring us back again and again. The minute
            we become
            attached to someone, we have to be born again and again. So what the Guru tells us is to turn this
            attachment into love.
            When we get attached to the people around us, the Guru tells us to bring in respect and start loving the
            entire world.
            Transform that attachment into love.
          </p>
          <p class="mb-4">
            Somebody once asked Guruji, "What is the difference between attachment and love?" Guruji explained that
            attachment will
            bind your life in such a way that the decisions you make based on attachment will be harmful for you and
            the people you
            love. She gave a very good example. She said, "If your child has diabetes and is eating something very
            sweet, as a
            parent, if you are attached to the child, that is attachment. But if you truly love him, you will realize
            that this is
            poison. In attachment, we become blind, but love helps us make the right decision at the right time."
          </p>

            Another example is when a child needs cough syrup, but instead, the parent gives vinegar and the child
            dies. This
            happens because the parent was attached to the child, so they were in a hurry and worried, and were not
            able to think
            properly. Now, let's come to the difference. Love makes you think in a broader perspective because out of
            attachment, we
            create a lot of Karma. Our attachment also increases when we are attached to someone. We become greedy and
            angry, so all
            these vices increase with attachment. There is more desire inside you, so your vice is increased. Karma is
            made on the
            basis of attachment, and it limits you. But when you love, you love unconditionally.
          </p>
          <p class="mb-4">
            Some may say that this is impossible to do, but if you look at Guruji's life, you will see that it's not
            so impossible.
            Just like how Bhagwan ji is loving everyone in this world, it can be done. When we get attached to people,
            we start
            expecting from them. But in love, there is no expectation, and these expectations hurt and disappoint us
            because we
            can't live up to everybody's expectations, and not everyone can live up to ours. When you truly love
            someone, you don't
            expect anything in return. Attachment is when we love with conditions. Attachment makes you weak, whereas
            love makes you
            strong. When you are attached to somebody or something, you are performing your duty, helping them, and
            doing
            everything, but it makes you weak. Love makes you make decisions in the right manner and makes you
            stronger.
          </p>
          <p class="mb-4">
            Attachment increases fear, whereas true love makes you fearless. When you have attachment and somebody
            comes home late,
            you constantly fear what happens to that person. You are constantly worried. But with true love, you
            become fearless.
            Whatever has to happen, has to happen. I have faith in my God. Attachment increases dependency, whereas
            love makes you
            independent.
          </p>
          <p class="mb-4">
            Guruji teaches us how to be independent. Guruji transforms our worldly attachment into true love for each
            other. We
            should strive for this beautiful transformation and not confine ourselves to a small world where we are
            only attached to
            a few people. Instead, we should embrace the bigger world, a world filled with love vibrating everywhere.
            However, it's
            important not to misunderstand this message. Don't think that you won't be able to fulfill your duties.
            The only
            difference is that attachment will make you fall, whereas true love will make you rise. When faced with a
            significant
            decision, ask yourself whether you are making it out of attachment or because it is the right thing to do.
            By doing so,
            you will start to notice the difference between attachment and true love. This awareness will help you
            progress because
            attachment doesn't disappear overnight. But with consistent practice, you can let go of attachment and
            spread true love
            unconditionally. To overcome attachment, we need a Guru and a strong connection with God.

              <span class="pb-1 border-b-4 border-double border-b-indigo-600">Ego (Ahankar)</span>
            </span>
            Now, let's talk about the fifth vice, ego (ahankar).
          </p>
          <p class="mb-4">
            Each one of us has this ego or false sense of self. We exhibit ego when we refer to our body as "me." For
            example,
            saying "I have money" or "I don't have money" both stem from ego. It's similar to playing the game of
            snakes and
            ladders, where snakes bring you down when they bite you. In life, when you do good things, show
            compassion, and love,
            you climb up the ladder. However, when any of these vices, such as ego, come into play, they act like
            snakes, biting and
            causing you to fall down. One of the biggest snakes is ego, represented by the 99th place in the game. You
            may achieve
            great success and reach new heights in life, but the moment you let pride take over and touch that 99th
            place, your ego
            brings you crashing down. Ego is extremely harmful, and we must realize that whatever we have achieved in
            life is due to
            God's grace. When we get caught up in ego, everything shatters. The constant use of the word "I" is a
            manifestation of
            ego. We need to let go of the idea that we exist as separate individuals.
          </p>
          <p class="mb-4">
            So, what is this ego that claims "I am so-and-so" and "I have achieved"? When someone says, "my body is
            hurting," it
            implies that they are separate from their body. But when you realize the truth, that you are not separate
            from your
            body, the ego naturally diminishes. We must transform this ego into awareness of who we truly are. We are
            not merely our
            bodies; we are souls. If I were to ask you, "Who are you?" you might initially respond with your name,
            gender, city,
            occupation, and other external aspects. These are the bricks that make up your life. However, these bricks
            shine because
            of the divine light within you, not because of their own inherent existence. We are born into this world
            without
            choosing our name, occupation, city, or even our family. We didn't choose our gender. So, what is there to
            be proud of?
            What is this false sense of self, ego, all about? We mistakenly believe that these shining external
            aspects are our true
            existence, and we polish them, unaware that they shine because of the divine light within us.
          </p>
          <p class="mb-4">
            Within each of us, there is peace, but these five vices rob us of our happiness and peace of mind. Lust,
            greed,
            attachment, ego, and anger are the five vices that overpower us. To regain our natural state, we need to
            channelize
            these vices in the right direction. It is up to us to transform each vice into a virtue.
          </p>
          <p class="mb-4">
            <span class="heading font-semibold text-rose-600 mb-4 block">
              <span class="pb-1 border-b-4 border-double border-b-rose-600">Conclusion</span>
            </span>
            Every time you feel proud, greedy, angry, or attached, just talk to yourself and ask why you are feeling
            proud or why
            these emotions are arising. Forget the external factors and focus on the divine light within you. Often,
            we become
            attached to material things that may be present in our lives today but can disappear tomorrow, such as
            money. If we
            understand that the divine light resides within us, we will not be swayed by these temporary voices and
            distractions.
            The Guru helps us avoid falling into the trap of these emotions by making us aware of our anger and
            attachments, which
            can ultimately lead to our downfall.
          </p>
          <p class="mb-4">
            Now, the question arises: should we eliminate these emotions entirely? Is it wrong to have a little anger
            or greed, or
            are these feelings natural? Consider this: even a small amount of poison can be detrimental and lead to
            harm. Similarly,
            even a drop of these negative emotions can lead to our downfall if we let them overpower us. They have the
            potential to
            destroy us. Therefore, we must channelize these emotions in a productive manner.
          </p>
          <p class="mb-4">
            The Guru teaches us to channelize these vices and transform them into virtues. Instead of blindly
            fulfilling our desires
            or suppressing them completely, we should seek guidance from wise individuals and be self-aware in order
            to defend
            ourselves against these vices. Our goal now is to redirect and harness these vices, turning them into
            virtuous actions.

                  work towards. It’s
