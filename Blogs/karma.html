              oday, we are addressing one of the most confusing topics: karma. Many people are confused about its very
              basic
              definition or foundation, which is that every action has a reaction. Whatever seeds you sow, you shall
              reap accordingly.
              If you sow seeds of happiness, you will experience happiness. Similarly, if you sow seeds of bitterness,
              you will reap
              bitter fruit. For example, if you plant a mango seed, you will eventually get mangoes. The consequence of
              our actions,
              or the fruit of our karma, is determined by the law of cause and effect. However, the confusion arises
              because we often
              wonder when we will receive the consequences of our karma. None of us can accurately predict when we will
              reap the fruit
              of our actions.

            </p>
            <p class="mb-4">
              Let's consider an analogy: if you plant coriander seeds today, you will have leaves within two weeks.
              However, if you
              plant mango seeds, it will take 20-25 years to bear fruit. If you plant an olive tree, it may take up to
              100 years to
              produce fruit. Hence, we cannot determine the fruit or the timing of the consequences of our karma.


            </p>
            <p class="mb-4">
              Now, there are three ways Guruji explains how karma is made: Kayak, Vachak, and Mansik. Kayak refers to
              actions
              performed by the physical body, such as harming someone, committing murder, or stealing from someone.
              Vachak refers to
              karma created through speech, as our words have the power to hurt or inspire others. Everything we say is
              also part of
              our karma. The most important and often overlooked is Mansik karma, which is karma created by our thoughts
              and
              intellect. How we think and what thoughts we entertain also contribute to our karma. In fact, 98% of our
              karma is
              created through our intellect. It's possible to appear nice on the outside but have negative thoughts and
              intentions
              inside. For instance, we may have a group of friends whom we treat nicely on the surface because we want
              to be seen as a
              kind person. However, internally, we judge them and may not genuinely love or accept someone because we
              consider them
              rude. These internal thoughts contribute to our karma.

            </p>
            <p class="mb-4">
              Another example is when guests unexpectedly arrive at our home during our resting or dinner time. Even
              though we may
              say, "Please come in," externally, our thoughts may be resentful, thinking, "Why are they coming now? This
              is my sleep
              time." These thoughts also contribute to our karma.


            </p>
            <p class="mb-4">
              The main crux behind Kayak, Vachak, and Mansik is the intention behind the karma. Let's take the example
              of learning
              boxing. The teacher may kick and punch you, but their intention is to teach you boxing skills. Although
              they physically
              hit you, the intention behind their actions is to help you learn. Our intentions are crucial, and Guruji
              emphasizes the
              importance of having pure intentions.

            </p>
            <p class="mb-4">
              Guruji often shares a story that perfectly exemplifies the power of intention. Once, two court cases were
              brought before
              a judge on the same day. In the first case, a girl was caught by the police while attempting to commit
              murder. She was
              apprehended with a gun in her hand before she could carry out the act. The judge penalized her. In the
              second case, a
              mother had just given birth to her child and accidentally suffocated the baby while sleeping. The judge,
              upon hearing
              this case, set the mother free, deeming her not guilty. In the first case, the murder wasn't committed,
              and no one died,
              yet the person received a penalty. The reason for this was the intention behind the person's actions—she
              intended to
              kill. In the second case, the child died due to suffocation, but the mother was not held responsible
              because her
              intention was not to kill. This story illustrates the importance of our intentions and how they shape the
              consequences
              of our actions.


            </p>
            <p class="mb-4">
              We often hear about good karma and bad karma. We do good karma because we expect good in return, and we
              fear doing bad
              karma because we anticipate negative consequences. Our intentions behind performing good karma can be
              selfish. We may
              seek validation, respect, or a good reputation by doing good deeds. However, it is essential to remember
              that our
              intentions matter more than the actions themselves. Guruji advises us to be mindful and cautious. The
              theory of karma
              may seem complex, but if our intentions are pure, everything becomes simpler. When we help someone with
              pure intentions,
              without any expectations, we are on the right path. Always remember that karma has a repelling effect: as
              you sow, so
              shall you reap.


            </p>
            <p class="mb-4">
              If you engage in any action, you are bound to face the consequences. Wrong deeds will bind you like
              handcuffs, while
              good deeds will bind you with golden handcuffs. Ultimately, you are bound by these handcuffs.


            </p>
            <p class="mb-4">
              To obtain the returns of good deeds, we have to keep returning to the circle of life. We have taken
              multiple life
              births, accumulating Karma from all our actions. This accumulated Karma is called sanchit Karma, which
              includes the
              entire bundle of good and bad deeds from our past lives. We individually choose from this sanchit Karma,
              not God or
              nature. In our next life, we pay for the selected Karma in the current life, known as prarabdha karma. We
              decide where
              we will be born, what actions we will perform, and where we will die. This is what we choose, and it is
              also known as
              destiny.


            </p>
            <p class="mb-4">
              The third type of Karma is kriyaman karma, which refers to the actions we are currently engaged in, the
              things we create
              on a daily basis. These actions also contribute to our accounts. Thus, there is sanchit Karma (accumulated
              throughout
              life), prarabdha karma (selected for the current life), and kriyaman karma (ongoing daily actions).


            </p>
            <p class="mb-4">
              This cycle of Karma is never-ending, as we constantly accumulate new Karma each day. The basket keeps
              filling up, and we
              keep returning to the circle of life and death. However, the power of knowledge (gyaan) can make the
              sanchit Karma zero.
              Once we attain true knowledge, the accumulated Karma is nullified. But there is a condition: from now on,
              we should not
              engage in any kriyaman karma, which means no more sin.

            </p>
            <p class="mb-4">
              This implies that we don't have to do good or bad actions. So, what should we do? Guruji suggests
              practicing nishkama
              karma, performing actions selflessly without any expectation of return and without egoistic attachment to
              the results.
              If there is no doer, then to whom will the Karma be attributed, whether good or bad? Therefore, we should
              engage in
              actions without expectations and false egos.


            </p>
            <p class="mb-4">
              With this knowledge, we can make the sanchit Karma zero, provided that we stop engaging in kriyaman karma
              and practice
              nishkama karma. However, we still have to face prarabdha karma since we have chosen it. Guruji advises us
              to remember
              God, as doing so prevents suffering. With this awareness, we don't have to react or act impulsively. We
              surrender
              everything to God, recognizing that we are not the doers, and whatever is written in our prarabdha will
              manifest.

            </p>
            <p class="mb-4">
              By practicing nishkama karma, we become one with God and are freed from the cycle of life. We gain control
              over our
              present actions, kriyaman karma, and if we abstain from creating new Karma while having a guru in this
              life, the purpose
              of our existence is fulfilled—to become one with God. The only way to achieve this is through nishkama
              karma.


            </p>
            <p class="mb-4">
              There is a joke that our guruji always tells us: One lizard said to another lizard, "Come, come! There is
              a party. Let's
              go to that party." The other lizard responded, "I can't come because if I leave, the entire wall will
              fall. I am holding
              this wall." This joke reflects our tendency to believe that we are indispensable and that the world will
              collapse
              without us. We harm our karma by allowing our ego to interfere, even expecting gratitude is not desirable,
              as it affects
              our actions.

              In conclusion, we are all interconnected. We should start recognizing ourselves in others and eliminate
              expectations
              from them. The moment we see others, our karma is set in motion. We must be mindful of our actions,
              freeing ourselves
              from attachments and practicing selfless action (nishkama karma) and unconditional love (nishkama
              bandhan). Expecting
              others to fulfill our expectations leads us down the path to suffering. Therefore, always maintain good
              intentions and
              perform selfless actions with love.
