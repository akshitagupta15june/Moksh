                        ur topic for today is life. When this topic arises, everyone's interpretation of it is likely to
                        be
                        different. Kids may
                        think life is full of homework and play, teenagers may associate life with friends, enjoying a
                        cup of
                        coffee, and
                        witnessing beautiful sunsets. Later on in life, it becomes about settling down, finding
                        financial
                        security, and
                        eventually, it revolves around raising and ensuring the well-being of our children. So, life
                        holds
                        different meanings
                        for each individual at different stages. However, if we look at life from a spiritual
                        perspective, what
                        does it truly
                        mean? When we refer to life, we are referring to the entirety of it, as a series of changeable
                        events.
                        Life is
                        constantly changing; it is not a singular thing, but rather a process that we must live through.


                    </p>
                    <p class="mb-4">
                        If we compare a photograph of ourselves as a kid to our present selves, we will notice numerous
                        physical
                        changes. We may
                        feel that the person we were back then and the person we are now are completely different. Life
                        is a
                        continuous series
                        of constant changes; it is always evolving. Every minute, there is a new definition of life,
                        always
                        presenting something
                        new for us to experience. During certain periods, we may feel that homework is important, while
                        at other
                        times, family
                        or work takes priority. However, when we consider life as a whole, it is an ever-changing
                        sequence of
                        events. Our
                        priorities, perspectives, and everything else in life are in a constant state of flux.

                    <img src="../images/butterfly.jpg" alt="">
                    <p class="mb-4">
                        Let's take the example of a caterpillar transforming into a butterfly. The process of change may
                        appear
                        painful, but
                        once it becomes a butterfly, it gains the ability to fly. Life presents similar changes that we
                        may not
                        always be
                        prepared for, making us feel lost or stuck. During such times, having a guru or mentor becomes
                        crucial. A
                        guru works
                        like Google Maps, guiding us and showing us the right direction in life. They also warn us when
                        we are on
                        the wrong
                        path, constantly providing guidance and suggesting alternative routes.


                    </p>
                    <p class="mb-4">
                        Whether we choose to follow the right path or not is ultimately our decision. As we discussed
                        earlier,
                        life is
                        constantly changing, and the guru teaches us to adapt to these changes. Today may be beautiful,
                        but
                        tomorrow will bring
                        something different. Situations around us are always changing, and if we become rigid and resist
                        change,
                        we are like a
                        tree in a storm that falls first. On the other hand, grass is flexible and bends with the
                        direction of the
                        wind. The
                        guru teaches us not to be rigid like a tree but to be like the grass—learning to adjust and bend
                        ourselves
                        according to
                        the circumstances.

                    </p>
                    <p class="mb-4">
                        Often, we try to change the scenarios around us, but that is not always within our control. What
                        we can
                        change is our
                        reaction to the situation. Our guru teaches us not to change our face but to face the change
                        itself. When
                        something
                        changes in our life or doesn't go as planned, we may instantly feel upset, sad, extremely happy,
                        or
                        express emotions
                        such as crying or anger through our facial expressions. However, in such situations, the guru
                        advises us
                        to maintain
                        composure, face the change with courage, and remember that we have our "Google Maps" guiding us.
                        With this
                        guidance,
                        there's no need to be afraid, as we know our destination. Life is meant to change, and we don't
                        have to be
                        happy all the
                        time. Circumstances are always changing, and we need to adapt to these changes.

                        To quote Charles Darwin, <i> "It is not the strongest species that survive, nor the most
                            intelligent, but
                            the one most
                            responsive to change."</i>

                    <p class="mb-4">
                        We cannot control the changes that are happening outside, but we can control the inner changes
                        occurring
                        within us. We
                        can change our reactions and our way of speaking and living. We have control over our behavior
                        and our
                        actions. All of
                        these things are within our power. So, instead of trying to change the external circumstances,
                        we should
                        focus on
                        changing ourselves. Otherwise, we become increasingly sad and angry.

                    <p class="mb-4">
                        One of the biggest fears that most of us have is the fear of aging or losing loved ones. These
                        changes are
                        inevitable
                        and part of life. We are afraid of losing someone we depend on. However, it's important to
                        realize that
                        nothing truly
                        dies. It's just a change in form. Our physical bodies may perish, but our essence continues to
                        exist.
                        Understanding this
                        truth about death can help us find peace.

                    </p>
                    <p class="mb-4">
                        Death is simply a transformation of our physical form. If we comprehend this truth about life,
                        we will be
                        able to live
                        life to the fullest without being affected by change. Therefore, having a Guru in our life is
                        crucial for
                        living a
                        fulfilled life. Now that we have this precious human life, do we truly value it?

                        We could have been born as insects, dogs, or cockroaches. The reason we have received this human
                        life is
                        far more
                        significant. Even animals drink, eat, produce offspring, and care for their young ones before
                        eventually
                        dying. So, why
                        have we been granted this human life? It is considered the highest form of life. We have been
                        given this
                        life to attain
                        inner peace.

                    <p class="mb-4">
                        As humans, we have the power of reasoning and the ability to find peace of mind through all the
                        circumstances that occur
                        in our lives. We can still be at peace, regardless of the external situations. What is your goal
                        in life?
                        What is your
                        purpose? The purpose of life is peace of mind, not money.

                        Just like a fish finds peace in water and not in honey, even if you place the fish in the most
                        expensive
                        alcohol, it
                        will only find peace in water. Similarly, in life, we chase after various things, constantly
                        changing our
                        minds.
                        Sometimes we chase after money or other desires. However, we forget that we can only truly
                        thrive in life
                        if we have
                        peace of mind. So, no matter where we are in life, our first priority should be to attain peace
                        of mind.
                        Only then can
                        we go on to achieve whatever we desire, but always ensuring that we maintain that inner peace.
                        With peace
                        of mind, we
                        can survive and thrive in any situation.

                    <p class="mb-4">
                        There will be a lot of duality in life, encompassing aspects such as death, happiness, sadness,
                        comfort,
                        insult, and
                        praise. All of these qualities are part of life, so it is important to maintain a balance amidst
                        this
                        duality. We should
                        remain the same whether experiencing sadness or happiness, birth or death, discomfort or
                        comfort. Guruji
                        and teachers
                        guide us on how not to become excessively happy or too sad. Now, we must follow the neutral
                        path, as
                        learning to balance
                        in life is crucial for achieving our desired direction. We must let go of the past and embrace
                        neutrality
                        and balance.
                        You are the captain of your life, with control over the direction it takes. Guruji can provide
                        guidance if
                        we are headed
                        in the wrong direction, but ultimately, the decision to change rests with us. Think of your life
                        as a boat
                        with you as
                        the captain; your decisions determine the direction you sail. Similarly, your body is like
                        another
                        metaphorical boat,
                        separate from your true self. Sometimes, life's challenges come in strong waves, and Guruji
                        teaches us how
                        to navigate
                        them. Remember, you are the captain of your ship, and you should row gently, not forcefully.
                        There will
                        always be two
                        paths in front of us, and whichever path we choose may involve depression or sadness. It is
                        essential to
                        learn how to
                        face these challenges with consciousness and awareness.


                    </p>
                    <p class="mb-4">
                        Our Guruji's mantra is "shukrana" and "muskurana," which means that we need to be genuinely
                        happy and
                        thankful to God at
                        all times. We should find joy in life and not burden ourselves with unnecessary stress. No
                        matter what the
                        external
                        circumstances are, our Guruji always tells us to thank God because He has a better plan for all
                        of us.
                        Even in the
                        Bhagavad Gita, it is written, "Prasannchit Wale Ko main shighra hi Darshan deta hun," which
                        means that
                        when you are
                        truly happy, God is present. We should strive to be genuinely happy, regardless of the
                        situation. Although
                        we cannot
                        change the outer circumstances, we can change our reactions to them. We should not fear the
                        future because
                        our God is
                        with us, and with faith, we can find strength and happiness in every situation.

                    <p class="mb-4">
                        Life is like a dream, an illusion. Our Guruji always emphasizes "Jagat mithya, Brahma Satya,"
                        meaning that
                        the world is
                        like an illusion, constantly changing, while the truth remains constant. When we are dreaming,
                        we believe
                        the dream to
                        be real, but upon waking up, we realize it was just a dream. Similarly, when we live our lives,
                        we
                        perceive them as real
                        and happening to us. However, Guruji comes and wakes us up, reminding us that life is like a
                        dream.

                    </p>
                    <p class="mb-4">
                        "Arise, awake, and stop not till your goal is achieved." Don't perceive life as real; it is akin
                        to a
                        dream. If I were
                        to ask you about your life, you would introduce yourself and perhaps share a brief overview of
                        your
                        childhood, which
                        would take a few minutes at most. Despite living for 30 or 40 years, you can summarize your life
                        in just a
                        few hours.
                        Life is like a play; observe and experience it.

                    <p class="mb-4">
                        Whatever situation there is in our life, whether good or bad, it will always pass. You will not
                        always
                        have happy
                        scenarios, nor will you always be in sad situations. This is another thing that Guruji says:
                        "This too
                        shall pass." Life
                        is just a passing show. What we need to do is watch it like a spectator without getting attached
                        to it. We
                        need to
                        realize that we are the creators of the dream play and not get stuck in this illusion. Life is
                        like a
                        dream.

                    <p class="mb-4">
                        Our Guruji tells the story of Raja Janak, a king who had a dream. Despite living a life of
                        riches and
                        luxury, one day he
                        dreamed of being a beggar, hungry and desperately begging for food. After a great struggle, he
                        finally
                        managed to get a
                        little porridge, but just as he was about to eat it, a dog came and took it away. Raja Janak
                        woke up in
                        turmoil and
                        called all the saints and learned men of his kingdom. He didn't tell them what he had seen, but
                        simply
                        asked, "Is this
                        the truth or that the truth?" No one could answer this question except for one child,
                        Ashtavakra, a
                        12-year-old boy with
                        eight twists in his body. He said, "This is not true, and that is also not true." He meant that
                        the dream
                        was not true,
                        and neither was reality. Both were just illusions. In conclusion, a true Guru comes and wakes us
                        up from
                        the dreamy
                        state. When we believe that our life is real and everything happening around us is real, in
                        reality life
                        is an illusion.
                        It is a passing show.

                        If you adopt the behavior of accepting everything in your life, you will live life to the
                        fullest. There
                        are two
                        principles to live life to the fullest. First, live your life as if today is your last day. If
                        today were
                        your last day,
                        would you waste it or hold grudges? Would you be rude to anyone? No, you would be kind and nice
                        and not
                        waste time. The
                        second principle is to live as if you are going to live forever. Would you be scared of living
                        if you were
                        going to live
                        forever? Any problem that comes in your life would seem insignificant because you are going to
                        live
                        forever. These two
                        principles may seem contradictory, but they make great sense. We have to think about it. Live as
                        if it's
                        your last day,
                        meaning live in the present moment and don't dwell on the past or future. Live happily in this
                        moment. The
                        second
                        principle is to live as if you will live forever, so don't waste time worrying about future
                        challenges and
                        problems.
                        Face them with a positive attitude and behavior towards life. Don't hold on to fears or be
                        scared of the
                        future, and all
                        your problems will seem insignificant and small because you know you are going to live on
                        forever.

                        We often think that we are human beings going through a spiritual experience, but the truth is
                        that we are
                        spiritual
                        beings going through a human experience. Whatever problems we face are insignificant and small.
                        If we keep
                        these two
                        principles in mind, we need to value this human form of life. Life, in general, is very rare,
                        and not
                        everyone gets it.
                        If we have a Guru in our life, we should make the most of it and value this human life. Don't
                        waste it.

                        killing
                        us. We waste
                        our lives on trivial and insignificant things, burdening ourselves with the weight of life.
                        Instead,
                        accept whatever
                        comes and move forward. With the grace of God, we will reach a beautiful destination.
