# Contributing Guidelines Moksh

This documentation contains a set of guidelines to help you during the contribution process.

## Submitting Contributionsüë©‚Äç

Below you will find the process and workflow used to review and merge your changes.

### Step 0 : Find an issue

- Take a look at the Existing Issues or create your **own** Issues!
- Wait for the Issue to be assigned to you after which you can start working on it.
- Note : Every change in this project should/must have an associated issue.



### Step 1 : Fork the Project

- Fork this Repository. This will create a Local Copy of this Repository on your Github Profile.
Keep a reference to the original project in `upstream` remote.  

```bash
git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/<repo-name>  
cd <repo-name>  
git remote add upstream https://github.com/<upstream-owner>/<repo-name>  
```  



- If you have already forked the project, update your copy before working.

```bash
git remote update
git checkout <branch-name>
git rebase upstream/<branch-name>
```  



### Step 2 : Branch

Create a new branch. Use its name to identify the issue your addressing.

```bash
# It will create a new branch with name Branch_Name and switch to that branch 
git checkout -b branch_name
```

### Step 3 : Work on the issue assigned

- Work on the issue(s) assigned to you.
- Add all the files/folders needed.
- After you've made changes or made your contribution to the project add changes to the branch you've just created by:

```bash  
# To add all new files to branch Branch_Name  
git add .  

# To add only a few files to Branch_Name
git add <some files>
```

### Step 4 : Commit

- To commit give a descriptive message for the convenience of reviewer by:

```bash
# This message get associated with all files you have changed  
git commit -m "message"  
```

- **NOTE**: A PR should have only one commit. Multiple commits should be squashed.

### Step 5 : Work Remotely

- Now you are ready to your work to the remote repository.
- When your work is ready and complies with the project conventions, upload your changes to your fork:

```bash  
# To push your work to your remote repository
git push -u origin Branch_Name
```


### Step 6 : Pull Request

- Go to your repository in browser and click on compare and pull requests.
Then add a title and description to your pull request that explains your contribution.

- Create a Pull Request which will be reviewed and suggestions would be added to improve it.
- Add Screenshots to help us know what this enhancement/implementation is all about.



## Alternatively, using GitHub Desktop: 
1. Open GitHub Desktop and log in to your GitHub account.

2. Make sure you are on the "Current Repository" view. If not, go to "File" and select "Add Local Repository" to add your repository.

3. In the "Current Repository" view, ensure you are on the branch that you want to submit a pull request for. If you're not on the correct branch, use the "Branch" menu to switch to the correct branch.

4. Once you're on the correct branch, make your changes and commit them to the branch. You can do this by clicking the "+" button in the upper-left corner of the GitHub Desktop window, making your changes, and then entering a commit message.

5. After you've made your changes and committed them, click the "Push origin" button in the top-right corner of the GitHub Desktop window. This will push your changes to the remote repository on GitHub.

6. Now, go to the GitHub website, navigate to your fork of the repository, and you should see a button to "Compare & pull request" between your fork and the original repository, click on it.

7. On the pull request page, you can review your changes and add any additional information, such as a title and a description, that you want to include with your pull request.

8. Once you're satisfied with your pull request, click the "Create pull request" button to submit it.

**Note:** In order to create a pull request, you must have a fork of the original repository in your GitHub account and you must have made the changes in that forked repository.

## Your Pull Request has been submitted and will be reviewed by the maintainer and merged.
