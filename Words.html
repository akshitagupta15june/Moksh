          <span class="fst-italic fw-semibold fs-3" style="color: #2980b9;">Words</span> are not just something you say, but they are a projection of your vibrations.
          <p>
            <b>For example</b> - constant chanting in a temple - you feel peaceful vibes.

            Experiment with a plant - say bad things to one plant and good things to another 

            (the positive one bloomed, the negative one died). Our words can have an impact on others as well as our own bodies.

            We need to raise our vibrations, as the universe is also listening. We need to be the radiator of power.
          </p>
          <p>


            <b>When someone asks, "How are you?" </b> <br>
            Say, "I am doing great. I am doing amazing." Your body and mind are listening too. 
            A doctor asked Dada Bhagwan, "How are you?" Their reply was, "I am better than you." 
            For example, in a playground, two children were playing on monkey bars. One mother told her child, "Don't fall, don't fall," 
            and the other told her child, "Hold on, hold on." The universe and the child's subconscious caught "fall," and the child fell. 
            On the other hand, the child who heard "hold on" kept holding on. Your words have an impact on the entire universe. 
            If you are rude to someone, today or tomorrow, it will come back to you in some way through an unexpected source. 
            We don't realize the impact of those rude or harsh words. Words are like a sword. The tongue is like a matchstick - it can set the whole forest ablaze. 
            In the same way, with your tongue/words, a whole lot of problems can be created. We are free to speak, but once spoken, 
            we are bound to face the consequences of your own words. If you curse another person, it will come back to you! So be careful what you speak. 
            Gossiping also adds to your karma. Raise the quality of your conversations.

            <br>
            <b>Analyze -</b> <br>
            - is it the truth?<br>
              If true, then how are you saying it? What is your tone? <br>
            - is it the right timing ?<br>
            - is it beneficial ?

          </p>

            <b>Power of Words Poem (photo)</b> <br>

            <b>How you greet -</b>  make someone's day by saying nice things - bend one's mind. 
            Manthra manipulated Kaikeyi's mind because of which Lord Ram went into exile for 14 years. 
            Words can manipulate someone's mind. Dadajis says, "Know the truth, and the truth will set you free." 
            You can be enlightened with words from a true Guru. Dada Bhagwan and Meera Bhagwan enlighten us with their words and knowledge. 
            Words don't only hurt in the present but even years after they are said - they act as missiles that can pierce the heart. 
            The tongue has no bones but has the power to break bones. Swami Vivekananda - with one speech could create a revolution in the youth. 
            Words of encouragement - free of thought and anxiety - freedom from mind and body. Words can push one to heights - words give us a morale boost. 
            Words help differentiate wrong from right. Words can make you weak.

          </p>

          <p>
            <b>WEAKNESS IS DEATH; WEAKNESS IS SIN</b> <br>
            Words - when someone projects their negativity/frustration on you - you have a choice not to take it in. 
            Words, before they are spoken, are in our control. Once spoken, we have to bear their consequences, which are completely out of our control. 
            God may forgive you, but your own nervous system will not. Contrast - one person makes a big deal, 
            another person says it's not a big deal - need to understand perspective. Everyone's capacity of understanding words is different. 
            We have to be understanding of another person's perspective as well.
          </p>
